# Primality Test
# Alice and Bob are meeting after a long time. As usual they love to play some math games. 
# This times Alice takes the call and decides the game. 
# The game is very simple, Alice says out an integer and Bob has to say whether the number is prime or not. 
# Bob as usual knows the logic but since Alice doesn't give Bob much time to think, so Bob decides to write a computer program.
# Help Bob accomplish this task by writing a computer program which will calculate whether the number is prime or not .
# Input: The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of testcases. T lines follow. 
# Each of the next T lines contains an integer N which has to be tested for primality.
# Output: For each test case output in a separate line, "yes" if the number is prime else "no."

# Determine if n is prime.
# Returns true or false
# n should be positive and an integer
